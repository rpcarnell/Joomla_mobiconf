# Joomla_mobiconf

The Joomla component was programmed around 2014. It was perhaps the first time I used AngularJS for a major project, so I found myself mixing jQuery and AngularJS a lot. 

The idea behind this Joomla component was allowing users to request, name, describe the mobile application they wanted. They'd be taken to a screen where they could customize the template, color, fonts (definitely hard to code), and then they'd pay, and the requirements would be sent to the programmer.

It was a good idea, but times change.
